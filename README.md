# Using woke in Github for Conscious Language scans

[Sergei Petrosian](mailto:spetrosi@redhat.com)

## Conscious LanguageIinitiative

 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) is an important focus of many organizations today. It is important for all users and developers to feel comfortable using and contributing to open source projects. Part of this is Conscious Language, using words and expressions that are inclusive rather than exclusive. The Linux System Roles project has recently begun using a tool called "woke" as part of our github action checking. Learn about the "woke" tool, how we are using it in Linux System roles github action checking, the hurdles we faced converting Linux System Roles to have more inclusive language, and ways you can help the "woke" project.
